Thanks for the security enhancements and earlier fixes. I need you to now wrap everything up and make the app fully functional and ready to launch. Here's what still needs urgent attention:

✅ Functional Bug Fixes
Swipe Logic Bug:

Fix swiping logic so that after a card is swiped, the next one loads centered and not in a swiped state.

Ensure profile card position is mobile-optimized and centered.

Preferences Section:

The "Dating Preferences" section doesn’t open or load.

Ensure users can view and update their preferences properly.

Age Display Bug:

Profiles are defaulting to age “18”.

Add a birthdate or age field during signup, store it, and calculate/display real age dynamically.

Photo Verification:

Add a camera-based verification step after uploading a profile picture to verify real users and prevent fake accounts.

Delete Account Option:

The “Delete Account” button does not work under “Privacy & Safety”.

Make it functional to permanently delete user data from both client and server.

Block Account Option:

“Block or Report Someone” doesn’t respond. Please implement this feature to:

Block further interaction with reported users

Log a report for moderation

Remove AI-generated Accounts:

Remove any dummy or AI-generated profiles from the production database so that only real users appear.

🔊 UI & UX Enhancements
Sound Effects:

Add subtle sound effects:

“Trash” sound when skipping

“Chime” or “positive” sound when liking/matching

Matches Dashboard:

On the Matches page, show:

Total Likes, Likes Received, Likes Given

Real-time Matches

Chat Integration:

When a match is formed, show the user in the Chat section automatically.

Add an automated message: “Say hi to your match!”

Profile Page – Settings Icon:

The top-right gear/settings icon doesn’t work.

Either remove it or make it open real settings/preferences.

🛡 Security Recap (Confirm Final Implementation)
Please confirm these are in place before we go live:

✅ Input validation & sanitization

✅ Proper password hashing & encryption

✅ Rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints

✅ Secure API integration

✅ Session control & authentication middleware

✅ Secure file upload & CSP configuration

✅ Safe storage of secrets and no hardcoded tokens in frontend

Once you’ve resolved all of the above and confirmed full functionality on web and mobile views, please package it as a production-ready release.

Let me know once it’s complete so I can begin launch preparations.

Thank you!
