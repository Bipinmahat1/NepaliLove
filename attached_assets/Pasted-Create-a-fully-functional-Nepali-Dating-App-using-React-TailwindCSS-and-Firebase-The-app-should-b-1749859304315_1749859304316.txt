Create a fully functional Nepali Dating App using React, TailwindCSS, and Firebase. The app should be mobile-first, fully responsive, and include the following features:

👥 User Authentication:
- Signup and login using email and phone number (use Firebase Auth)
- Validate phone number using Firebase phone auth with OTP
- No complex registration required, just name, phone, and email

📝 Profile Creation:
- After login, redirect user to fill profile details:
  - Name, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, bio, dating intentions
  - Upload up to 5 profile photos and 1 short video (Firebase Storage)
  - Set preferences: preferred age range, gender, religion, etc.

💘 Match Interface:
- Tinder-style card swiping UI (1 profile visible at a time)
- Show user’s name, age, ethnicity, profile photo(s), and bio
- Swipe right to like, left to skip (with animations)
- If both users like each other, mark them as matched

💬 Chat System:
- All users can message each other freely (match not required)
- Real-time chat using Firebase Firestore (or Realtime DB)
- Basic chatbox with message history, sender info, and auto scroll

🛠️ Profile Management:
- User can edit profile at any time
- Change profile picture, re-upload photos/videos, update bio
- Option to deactivate profile

🌐 App Title & Branding:
- Title: "Nepali Dating App – We Connect Two Hearts"
- Use red/pink/white theme with modern fonts and smooth animations
- Show Nepali flag emoji 🇳🇵 near user’s name

📱 UI & UX:
- Fully responsive layout using TailwindCSS
- Smooth animations for swiping, loading, transitions
- Use default avatars if photo is missing
- Handle all edge cases (no matches, no internet, empty fields)

🔐 Tech Stack:
- React for frontend (with hooks)
- TailwindCSS for UI
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- Hosting-ready project structure

🎯 Final Outcome:
The project should be complete, deployable, and ready to test. User can sign up, fill a profile, swipe others, chat instantly, and edit their profile. All Firebase features must be integrated and working properly.
